# Stock Management System for Small Marts

A Django-based web application designed to help small marts efficiently manage their inventory. This system allows staff to track stock levels, record transactions, and receive low-stock alerts, making it a practical tool for small business operations.

## Features

- **Product Management:** Add, edit, and delete products with details like name, category, price, and stock quantity.
- **Stock Transactions:** Record stock additions (restocking) and removals (sales) with automatic stock updates.
- **Dashboard:** View current stock levels with highlighted low-stock items (≤5 units).
- **Categories:** Organize products into categories (e.g., Groceries, Beverages).
- **User-Friendly Frontend:** Simple interface for staff to add transactions without needing admin access.
- **Admin Panel:** Advanced management for products, categories, and transactions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MartStockSystem.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd MartStockSystem
   ```
3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```
5. **Apply Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```
6. **Create a Superuser (for Admin Access):**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   - Follow prompts to set a username, email (optional), and password.

## Usage

1. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
2. **Access the Application:**
   - **Dashboard:** Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see current stock levels.
   - **Add Transactions:** Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/add-transaction/` to record stock changes.
   - **Admin Panel:** Log in at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` with your superuser credentials to manage data.

3. **Example Workflow:**
   - Add a category (e.g., "Beverages") and a product (e.g., "Cola," Price: $1.99, Stock: 50) via the admin panel.
   - Record a "Stock In" transaction of 20 units via the frontend—stock updates to 70.
   - Sell 10 units ("Stock Out")—stock drops to 60, with low-stock alerts if it falls below 5.

### How to Add This README to Your Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   - Open your terminal:
     ```
     cd ~/path/to/MartStockSystem
     ```

2. **Create or Update `README.md`:**
   - If it doesn’t exist yet:
     ```
     nano README.md
     ```
   - If it does, overwrite it:
     ```
     nano README.md
     ```
   - Copy-paste the content above.
   - **Customize:**
     - Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.
     - Replace `yourprofile` with your LinkedIn profile ID (e.g., `johndoe123`).
     - Add your name at the bottom (e.g., “Built by John Doe”).
   - Save and exit: `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`.

3. **Stage and Commit:**
   - Add the README to Git:
     ```
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add detailed README for Stock Management System"
     ```

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   - If you haven’t set the remote yet:
     ```
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/MartStockSystem.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - If already set (e.g., from a previous push attempt):
     ```
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Enter your GitHub username and PAT when prompted.

5. **Verify:**
   - Visit `https://github.com/yourusername/MartStockSystem`.
   - Ensure the README renders nicely at the bottom of the repo page.

### Why This README Works
- **Clarity:** Explains what the project does and how to use it—crucial for hackathon judges or recruiters.

- **Resume Boost:** Links to your GitHub and LinkedIn, tying it to your online presence.
- **Hackathon Appeal:** Highlights practical features and scalability, showing real-world utility.

---

### Troubleshooting
- **Push Fails:** If you get “Invalid username or password,” recheck your PAT at `https://github.com/settings/tokens` (must have `repo` scope) and retry.
- **README Not Showing:** Ensure it’s named `README.md` (case-sensitive) and pushed to the `main` branch.
- **Missing Files:** If other project files aren’t uploaded yet, run `git add .` and `git commit -m "Add all project files"` before pushing.
